# AnalyticLC

Generate an analytic light-curve, and optionally RV and astrometry data, from a set of initial (free) orbital
elements.

The full logic of AnalyticLC and the model derivation are described in the paper "An Accurate 3D Analytic Model for Exoplanetary Photometry, Radial Velocity and
Astrometry" by Judkovsky, Ofir and Aharonson (2021), please cite this paper upon usage. 

AnalyticLC was implemented in MATLAB; a Python wrapper can be found here: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/lisamarie.beckmann/analyticpy

Model and enjoy :)
